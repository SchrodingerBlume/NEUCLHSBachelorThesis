The graduation project (thesis) is a fundamental element in fulfilling graduation requirements and serves as a key criterion for evaluating the achievement of educational objectives. The process of writing the thesis reflects the quality of the research work and plays an important role in fostering students’ sense of engineering and practical awareness, teamwork, and ability to apply what they have learned to conduct scientific research and solve real-world problems. Acquiring the basic skills of thesis writing is therefore an essential part of undergraduate education.

To make it easier for undergraduates in our college (and also, to be frank, for my own use) to prepare their theses, I have created this non-official \LaTeX\ template for the Undergraduate Thesis of the College of Life and Health Sciences, Northeastern University, intended for students who prefer using \LaTeX\ for writing.

This template is built strictly in accordance with the official requirements of the College of Life and Health Sciences and has been carefully refined through detailed comparison with the provided official example to ensure close consistency in formatting and details. To make it more user-friendly, the template also includes a practical guide tailored to the characteristics of writing with \LaTeX.
